## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a potential security issue, please report it using the
[private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature of GitHub to
automatically inform all relevant team members. Otherwise, please
get in touch with stefan6419846 through e-mail (current maintainer,
address in GitHub profile).

We will try to find a fix in a timely manner and will then issue a security
advisory together with the update via GitHub
([example](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/security/advisories/GHSA-xcjx-m2pj-8g79)).

If you don't get a reaction within 30 days, please open a public issue on
GitHub.
