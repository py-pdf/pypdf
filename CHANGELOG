Version 1.13, 2010-12-04
------------------------

 - Fixed a typo in code for reading a "\b" escape character in strings.

 - Improved __repr__ in FloatObject.

 - Fixed a bug in reading octal escape sequences in strings.

 - Added getWidth and getHeight methods to the RectangleObject class.

 - Fixed compatibility warnings with Python 2.4 and 2.5.

 - Added addBlankPage and insertBlankPage methods on PdfFileWriter class.

 - Fixed a bug with circular references in page's object trees (typically
   annotations) that prevented correctly writing out a copy of those pages.

 - New merge page functions allow application of a transformation matrix.

 - To all patch contributors: I did a poor job of keeping this ChangeLog
   up-to-date for this release, so I an missing attributions here for any
   changes you submitted.  Sorry!  I'll do better in the future.


Version 1.12, 2008-09-02
------------------------

 - Added support for XMP metadata.

 - Fix reading files with xref streams with multiple /Index values.

 - Fix extracting content streams that use graphics operators longer than 2
   characters.  Affects merging PDF files.


Version 1.11, 2008-05-09
------------------------

 - Patch from Hartmut Goebel to permit RectangleObjects to accept NumberObject
   or FloatObject values.

 - PDF compatibility fixes.

 - Fix to read object xref stream in correct order.

 - Fix for comments inside content streams.


Version 1.10, 2007-10-04
------------------------

 - Text strings from PDF files are returned as Unicode string objects when
 pyPdf determines that they can be decoded (as UTF-16 strings, or as
 PDFDocEncoding strings).  Unicode objects are also written out when
 necessary.  This means that string objects in pyPdf can be either
 generic.ByteStringObject instances, or generic.TextStringObject instances.

 - The extractText method now returns a unicode string object.

 - All document information properties now return unicode string objects.  In
 the event that a document provides docinfo properties that are not decoded by
 pyPdf, the raw byte strings can be accessed with an "_raw" property (ie.
 title_raw rather than title)

 - generic.DictionaryObject instances have been enhanced to be easier to use.
 Values coming out of dictionary objects will automatically be de-referenced
 (.getObject will be called on them), unless accessed by the new "raw_get"
 method.  DictionaryObjects can now only contain PdfObject instances (as keys
 and values), making it easier to debug where non-PdfObject values (which
 cannot be written out) are entering dictionaries.

 - Support for reading named destinations and outlines in PDF files.  Original
 patch by Ashish Kulkarni.

 - Stream compatibility reading enhancements for malformed PDF files.

 - Cross reference table reading enhancements for malformed PDF files.

 - Encryption documentation.

 - Replace some "assert" statements with error raising.

 - Minor optimizations to FlateDecode algorithm increase speed when using PNG
 predictors.

Version 1.9, 2006-12-15
-----------------------

 - Fix several serious bugs introduced in version 1.8, caused by a failure to
   run through our PDF test suite before releasing that version.

 - Fix bug in NullObject reading and writing.

Version 1.8, 2006-12-14
-----------------------

 - Add support for decryption with the standard PDF security handler.  This
   allows for decrypting PDF files given the proper user or owner password.

 - Add support for encryption with the standard PDF security handler.

 - Add new pythondoc documentation.

 - Fix bug in ASCII85 decode that occurs when whitespace exists inside the
   two terminating characters of the stream.

Version 1.7, 2006-12-10
-----------------------

 - Fix a bug when using a single page object in two PdfFileWriter objects.

 - Adjust PyPDF to be tolerant of whitespace characters that don't belong
   during a stream object.

 - Add documentInfo property to PdfFileReader.

 - Add numPages property to PdfFileReader.

 - Add pages property to PdfFileReader.

 - Add extractText function to PdfFileReader.


Version 1.6, 2006-06-06
-----------------------

 - Add basic support for comments in PDF files.  This allows us to read some
   ReportLab PDFs that could not be read before.

 - Add "auto-repair" for finding xref table at slightly bad locations.

 - New StreamObject backend, cleaner and more powerful.  Allows the use of
   stream filters more easily, including compressed streams.

 - Add a graphics state push/pop around page merges.  Improves quality of
   page merges when one page's content stream leaves the graphics 
   in an abnormal state.

 - Add PageObject.compressContentStreams function, which filters all content
   streams and compresses them.  This will reduce the size of PDF pages,
   especially after they could have been decompressed in a mergePage
   operation.

 - Support inline images in PDF content streams.

 - Add support for using .NET framework compression when zlib is not
   available.  This does not make pyPdf compatible with IronPython, but it
   is a first step.

 - Add support for reading the document information dictionary, and extracting
   title, author, subject, producer and creator tags.

 - Add patch to support NullObject and multiple xref streams, from Bradley
   Lawrence.


Version 1.5, 2006-01-28
-----------------------

- Fix a bug where merging pages did not work in "no-rename" cases when the
  second page has an array of content streams.

- Remove some debugging output that should not have been present.


Version 1.4, 2006-01-27
-----------------------

- Add capability to merge pages from multiple PDF files into a single page
  using the PageObject.mergePage function.  See example code (README or web
  site) for more information.

- Add ability to modify a page's MediaBox, CropBox, BleedBox, TrimBox, and
  ArtBox properties through PageObject.  See example code (README or web site)
  for more information.

- Refactor pdf.py into multiple files: generic.py (contains objects like
  NameObject, DictionaryObject), filters.py (contains filter code),
  utils.py (various).  This does not affect importing PdfFileReader
  or PdfFileWriter.

- Add new decoding functions for standard PDF filters ASCIIHexDecode and
  ASCII85Decode.

- Change url and download_url to refer to new pybrary.net web site.


Version 1.3, 2006-01-23
-----------------------

- Fix new bug introduced in 1.2 where PDF files with \r line endings did not
  work properly anymore.  A new test suite developed with various PDF files
  should prevent regression bugs from now on.

- Fix a bug where inheriting attributes from page nodes did not work.


Version 1.2, 2006-01-23
-----------------------

- Improved support for files with CRLF-based line endings, fixing a common
  reported problem stating "assertion error: assert line == "%%EOF"".

- Software author/maintainer is now officially a proud married person, which
  is sure to result in better software... somehow.


Version 1.1, 2006-01-18
-----------------------

- Add capability to rotate pages.

- Improved PDF reading support to properly manage inherited attributes from
  /Type=/Pages nodes.  This means that page groups that are rotated or have
  different media boxes or whatever will now work properly.

- Added PDF 1.5 support.  Namely cross-reference streams and object streams.
  This release can mangle Adobe's PDFReference16.pdf successfully.


Version 1.0, 2006-01-17
-----------------------

- First distutils-capable true public release.  Supports a wide variety of PDF
  files that I found sitting around on my system.

- Does not support some PDF 1.5 features, such as object streams,
  cross-reference streams.
