# Contributors

PyPDF2 had a lot of contributors since it started with pyPdf in 2005. We are
a free software project without any company affiliation. We cannot pay
contributors, but we do value their contributions. A lot of time, effort, and
expertise went into this project. With this list, we recognize those awesome
people 🤗

The list is definitely not complete. You can find more contributors via the git
history and [GitHubs 'Contributors' feature](https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/graphs/contributors).

  being super helpful in answering issues / discussions or being very active on
  Stackoverflow, we also consider them being contributors to PyPDF2.
