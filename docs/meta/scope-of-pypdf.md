# Scope of pypdf

What features should pypdf have and which features will it never have?

pypdf aims at simplifying interactions with PDF documents. Core tasks that
pypdf can perform are:

* Document manipulation: Splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files
* Data Extraction: Extract text and metadata from PDF documents
* Security: Decrypt / encrypt PDF documents

Typical indicators that pypdf should do something:

* The task needs in-depth knowledge of the PDF format
* It currently requires a lot of code or even is impossible to do with pypdf
* It's neither mentioned in "belongs in user code" nor in "out of scope"
* It already is in the issue list with the [is-feature tag](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/labels/is-feature).

The [moonshot extensions](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/discussions/1181) are
features we would like to have, but are currently not able to add (PRs are
welcome ðŸ˜‰)

## Belongs in user code

Here are a few indicators that a feature belongs into users' code (and not into pypdf):

1. The use-case is very specific. Most people will not encounter the same need.
2. It can be done without knowledge of the PDF specification
3. It cannot be done without (non-pdf) domain knowledge. Anything that is
   specific to your industry.

## Out of scope

While this list is infinitely long, there are a few topics that are asked
multiple times.

Those topics are out of scope for pypdf. They will never be part of pypdf:

1. **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: OCR is about extracting text from
   images. That is very different from the kind of text extraction pypdf is
   doing. Please note that images can be within PDF documents. In the case of
   scanned documents, the whole page is an image. Some scanners automatically
   execute OCR and add a text-layer behind the scanned page. That is something
   pypdf can use if it's present. As a rule-of-thumb: If you cannot mark/copy
   the text, it's likely an image. A noteworthy open source OCR project is
   [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
2. **Format Conversion**: Converting docx / HTML to PDF or PDF to those formats.
   You might want to have a look at [`pdfkit`](https://pypi.org/project/pdfkit/)
   and similar projects.

Out of scope for the moment, but might be added if there are enough contributors:

* **Digital Signature Support** ([reference ticket](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/issues/302)): Cryptography is
  complicated. It's important to get it right. pypdf currently doesn't have
  enough active contributors to properly add digital signature support. For the
  moment, [pyhanko](https://pypi.org/project/pyHanko/) seems to be the best choice.
* **PDF Generation from Scratch**: pypdf can manipulate existing PDF documents,
  add annotations, combine / split / crop / transform. It can add blank pages.
  But if you want to generate invoices, you might want to have a look at
  [`reportlab`](https://pypi.org/project/reportlab/) /
  [`fpdf2`](https://pypi.org/project/fpdf2/) or document conversion tools like
  [`pdfkit`](https://pypi.org/project/pdfkit/).
* **Replacing words within a PDF**: [Extracting text from PDF is hard](../user/extract-text.md#why-text-extraction-is-hard).
   Replacing text in a reliable way is even harder. For example, one word might
   be split into multiple tokens. Hence, it's not a simple "search and replace"
   in some cases.
* **(Not) Extracting headers/footers/page numbers**: While you can apply
  heuristics, there is no way to always make it work. PDF documents simply
  don't contain the information what a header/footer/page number is.


### Library vs. Application

It's also worth pointing out that `pypdf` is designed to be a library. It is not
an application. That has several implications:

* Execution: pypdf cannot be executed directly, but only be called from within
  a program written by a pypdf user. In contrast, an application is executed
  on its own.
* Dependencies: pypdf should have a minimal set of dependencies and only
  restrict them where it is strictly necessary. In contrast, applications should
  be installed in environments which are isolated from other applications. They
  can pin their dependencies.

If you're looking for a way to interact with PDF files via Shell, you should
either write a script using pypdf or use [`pdfly`](https://pypi.org/project/pdfly/).
