# History of pypdf

## The Origins: pyPdf (2005-2010)

In 2005, [Mathieu Fenniak] launched pyPdf "as a PDF toolkit..."
focused on

-   document manipulation: by-page splitting, concatenation, and
    merging;
-   document introspection;
-   page cropping; and
-   document encryption and decryption.

The last release of PyPI was [pyPdf 1.13](https://pypi.org/project/pyPdf/#history)
in 2010.

## PyPDF2 is born (2011-2016)

At the end of 2011, after consultation with Mathieu and others, Phaseit
sponsored PyPDF2 as a fork of pyPdf on GitHub. The initial impetus was
to handle a wider range of input PDF instances; Phaseit\'s commercial
work often encounters PDF instances \"in the wild\" that it needs to
manage (mostly concatenate and paginate), but that deviate so much from
PDF standards that pyPdf can\'t read them. PyPDF2 reads a considerably
wider range of real-world PDF instances.

Neither pyPdf nor PyPDF2 aims to be universal, that is, to provide all
possible PDF-related functionality. Note that the similar-appearing
[pyfpdf] of Mariano Reingart is most comparable to [ReportLab], in that
both ReportLab and pyfpdf emphasize document generation. Interestingly
enough, pyfpdf builds in a basic HTMLâ†’PDF converter while PyPDF2 has no
knowledge of HTML.

So what is PyPDF2 truly about? Think about popular [pdftk] for a moment.
PyPDF2 does what pdftk does, and it does so within your current Python
process, and it handles a wider range of variant PDF formats
\[explain\]. PyPDF2 has its own FAQ to answer other questions that have
arisen.

The Reddit [/r/python crowd chatted] obliquely and briefly about PyPDF2
in March 2012.

The core developer / maintainer was Matthew Stamy.

## PyPDF3 and PyPDF4 (2018 - 2022)

Two approaches were made to get PyPDF2 active again: PyPDF3 and PyPDF4.

PyPDF3 had it's first release in 2018 and its last one in February 2022.
It never got the user base from PyPDF2.

PyPDF4 only had one release in 2018.

## PyPDF2: Reborn (2022)

Martin Thoma took over maintenance of PyPDF2 in April 2022. It had over 100
open PRs and 321 open issues.

[pubpub-zz](https://github.com/pubpub-zz) was extremely active, especially
for text extraction.

[Matthew Peveler](https://github.com/MasterOdin) helped a lot with reviews
and general project decisions.

[exiledkingcc](https://github.com/exiledkingcc) added support for modern
encryption schemes.


## pypdf: Back to the Roots (2023-2024)

In order to make things simpler for beginners, PyPDF2 was merged back into
pypdf. Now all lowercase, without a number. We hope that the folks who
develop PyPDF3 and PyPDF4 also join us.

Compared to `PyPDF2 >= 3.0.0`, `pypdf >= 3.1.0` now offers:

* AES reading and writing support. Not only with PyCryptoDome, but also with cryptography.
* Text extraction improvements, e.g. for math content. [pypdf is now comparable with Tika, pypdfium2, and PyMuPDF](https://github.com/py-pdf/benchmarks)
* Annotation support
* Performance Improvements and Bugfixes
* Page Label support

stefan6419846 made his [first PR for pypdf](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/2022)
in July 2023 and joined the project.
